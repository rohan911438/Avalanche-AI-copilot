# MetaMask Integration Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **`this[#x][e]?.addListener is not a function` error:**
   - Root cause: Incompatibility between MetaMask's provider implementation and Next.js, particularly with event handling methods.
   - Solution: Created a robust patching script that provides fallback implementations for event handling methods.

2. **`You rejected the connection request or no accounts were found` error:**
   - Root cause: Inadequate error handling in the wallet connection process.
   - Solution: Improved error handling with more specific messages and graceful degradation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. metamask-fix.js

Created a script that runs before any MetaMask interactions to patch the provider's methods:

- Safely extracts and stores the original event methods
- Implements robust fallbacks when original methods fail
- Creates a custom event system as a last resort
- Adds specific handling for common MetaMask errors
- Patches the request method to handle account changes properly

### 2. web3Utils.js Improvements

- Enhanced `requestAccounts()` function with better error handling
- Added timeout protection to prevent hanging
- Improved error messages based on MetaMask error codes
- Implemented more robust event handling utilities

### 3. ContractDeployer.js Updates

- Used enhanced utility functions for all MetaMask interactions
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added delayed initialization to ensure patches are applied
- Implemented safer event handling

## Testing Plan

1. **Basic Connection Test:**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Verify MetaMask popup appears
   - Approve connection
   - Verify account address displays correctly
   - Verify AVAX balance displays

2. **Rejection Test:**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Reject the connection in MetaMask
   - Verify appropriate error message displays
   - Verify application remains functional

3. **Account Change Test:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Change account in MetaMask
   - Verify the UI updates with the new account

4. **Network Change Test:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Change network in MetaMask
   - Verify application handles network change appropriately

5. **Contract Deployment Test:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Compile a simple contract
   - Estimate gas
   - Deploy contract
   - Verify successful deployment

## Potential Further Improvements

1. **Caching Mechanism:**
   - Implement local storage caching for last connected account

2. **Connection Status Monitor:**
   - Add a periodic check to detect disconnections

3. **Network Validation:**
   - Enhance network validation to provide better guidance for Avalanche networks

4. **Error Telemetry:**
   - Add error tracking to collect information on MetaMask integration issues
