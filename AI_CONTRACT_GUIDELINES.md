# Guidelines for AI-Generated Smart Contracts in Avalanche Project

To ensure easy compilation of any AI-generated smart contract code in our frontend, always follow these rules:

## 1. NO IMPORTS ALLOWED

❌ NEVER use import statements like:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/...";
import "./ContractName.sol";
import "https://github.com/...";
```

## 2. ALWAYS INLINE ALL DEPENDENCIES

✅ Instead, copy the full code of any required contract and include it directly:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// First include the dependency contracts
contract DependencyContract {
    // Full implementation here
    // ...
}

// Then your main contract that inherits from them
contract MainContract is DependencyContract {
    // Your implementation
    // ...
}
```

## 3. USE COMPATIBLE SOLIDITY VERSION

When possible, use a pragma that's compatible with our compiler:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

## Example Prompt for AI:

"Generate a smart contract for [YOUR REQUEST], but please don't use any imports. 
Instead, inline all dependencies directly in the same file. This is for a project 
with a compiler that doesn't support file import callbacks."

By following these guidelines, any contract generated by AI will compile successfully in our frontend application.
