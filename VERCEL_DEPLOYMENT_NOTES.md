# Vercel Serverless Function Limitations and Considerations

For Avalanche AI Copilot deployment on Vercel, keep these limitations in mind:

## Execution Time Limits
- **Serverless Functions**: Max execution time of 10 seconds (Hobby plan)
- **Potential Impact**: Contract compilation and AI generation might exceed this limit
- **Solution**: Proxy complex/long-running operations to a dedicated backend service (already implemented)

## Memory Limits
- **Serverless Functions**: 1024MB RAM limit
- **Potential Impact**: Complex AI operations might use significant memory
- **Solution**: Keep AI prompts concise and optimize code; proxy heavy operations to backend

## Cold Start Delays
- **First Request**: May experience latency after periods of inactivity
- **Solution**: Consider keeping functions "warm" with periodic pings for production use

## Bundle Size Limits
- **Function Size**: Maximum of 50MB per function
- **Impact**: Not likely an issue as we're proxying heavy dependencies

## Region Selection
- **Default**: Vercel deploys to closest region
- **Consideration**: For consistent performance, may want to force deployment to specific regions closer to target users

## Environment Variables
- **Secret Keys**: Must be set in Vercel dashboard
- **Reminder**: Set GEMINI_API_KEY and BACKEND_URL in Vercel project settings

## Connection Limits
- **Open Connections**: Limited to 1024 concurrent connections
- **Impact**: Only relevant with very high traffic

## Statelessness
- **No Persistence**: Functions cannot store state between invocations
- **Solution**: Use external services for any required persistence

## Recommendations
1. Deploy backend service separately on a platform without tight execution limits
2. Configure proper timeouts for cross-service API calls
3. Implement robust error handling for service unavailability
4. Monitor performance metrics after deployment to identify bottlenecks
