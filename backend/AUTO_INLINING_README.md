# Avalanche Smart Contract Auto-Inlining System (Enhanced)

This feature automatically transforms any contract with import statements into a self-contained contract with all dependencies inlined, with advanced support for nested dependencies.

## How It Works

When a contract is submitted for compilation through the frontend:

1. The system detects all import statements recursively
2. It resolves dependencies with a tree-based approach, handling nested imports
3. The system avoids circular dependencies with dependency tracking
4. Each dependency is processed only once with an efficient caching system
5. The resulting contract is self-contained with all dependencies properly inlined
6. The transformed contract is compiled and deployed

## Benefits

- Users can paste contract code with standard imports - the system handles the rest
- No need to instruct users to inline dependencies manually
- Supports OpenZeppelin contracts and other common libraries
- Handles nested imports properly (e.g., Pausable imports Context)
- Eliminates compilation errors due to missing imports
- Avoids duplicate contracts and circular dependencies

## Supported Libraries

The system currently supports automatic inlining for:

- ReentrancyGuard
- Ownable
- Pausable
- Context (used by many OpenZeppelin contracts)
- ERC20
- And many more...

## Implementation Details

The transformation happens in `importResolver.js` which:

1. Parses the original contract to extract imports
2. Recursively resolves all dependencies and their imports
3. Builds a dependency tree to avoid circular dependencies
4. Uses caching to improve performance and avoid duplicate work
5. Maintains a library of common contract implementations
6. Intelligently resolves local file paths using multiple strategies
7. Assembles a new contract with all dependencies properly inlined
8. Preserves the original license and pragma directives

## Advanced Features

The enhanced import resolver includes:

1. **Recursive Dependency Resolution**
   - Automatically finds and processes imports at any nesting level
   - Handles transitive dependencies (A imports B, B imports C)

2. **Dependency Tree Tracking**
   - Builds a dependency tree for visualization and debugging
   - Avoids circular dependencies with intelligent detection
   - Preserves proper inheritance structure

3. **Smart Path Resolution**
   - Handles various import formats (`import "./File.sol"`, `import "../utils/File.sol"`)
   - Resolves paths intelligently by checking multiple locations
   - Supports absolute and relative paths

4. **Caching Mechanism**
   - Resolves each dependency only once with efficient caching
   - Improves performance for contracts with many imports
   - Ensures consistency across dependencies

## API Usage

The compile-contract API endpoint automatically transforms any contract code before compilation:

```javascript
// Example API call
fetch('/api/compile-contract', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contractCode: contractWithImports
  }),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // data.abi - The contract ABI
  // data.bytecode - The contract bytecode
  // data.transformedCode - The inlined version of the contract with all nested dependencies resolved
});
```

## Testing

Use `test-import-resolver.js` to verify the transformation process works correctly with nested dependencies.
